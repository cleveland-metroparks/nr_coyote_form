# nr_coyote_form

This is a form for gathering coyote sighting data from the public that is focused on getting map coordinates to go with the data for tracking, follow-up, and management decisions.  It was developed for use in a large urban park system ([Cleveland Metroparks](www.clevelandmetroparks.com)).
